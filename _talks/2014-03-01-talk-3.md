VGG16 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was originally designed for image classification tasks. However, its deep architecture and large number of parameters make it well-suited for feature extraction in various computer vision applications, including face recognition and facial expression analysis. More information you can find [here](/files/vgg16.pdf).
