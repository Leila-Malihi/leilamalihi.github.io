excerpt: ' Chronic wounds are ulcerations of the skin that fail to heal because of an
underlying condition such as diabetes mellitus or venous insufficiency. The timely
identification of this condition is crucial for healing. However, this identification
requires expert knowledge unavailable in some care situations. Here, artificial
intelligence technology may support clinicians. In this study, we explore the
performance of a deep convolutional neural network to classify diabetic foot and
venous leg ulcers using wound images. We trained a convolutional neural network
on 863 cropped wound images. Using a hold-out test set with 80 images, the model
yielded an F1-score of 0.85 on the cropped and 0.70 on the full images. This study
shows promising results. However, the model must be extended in terms of wound
images and wound types for application in clinical practice. '
