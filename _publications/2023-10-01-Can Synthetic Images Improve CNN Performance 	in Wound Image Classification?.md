excerpt: 'This paper is about the Machine Learning (ML) based AI systems require a large amount of labelled training data to achieve this level. In cases of a shortage of such large amounts, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are a standard tool for synthesising artificial training images that can be used to augment the data set. We investigated the quality of synthetic wound images regarding two aspects: (i) improvement of wound-type classification by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and (ii) how realistic such images look to clinical experts (n = 217). Concerning (i), results show a slight classification improvement. However, the connection between classification performance and the size of the artificial data set is still unclear. Regarding (ii), although the GAN could produce highly realistic images, the clinical experts took them for real in only 31% of the cases. It can be concluded that image quality may play a more significant role than data size in improving the CNN-based classification result..'
