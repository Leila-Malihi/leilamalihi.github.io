polarization at ISM band for biomedical applications, 10th International Conference
on Information Technology"

excerpt: 'In this paper, a new wide band Micro strip antenna for implantable biomedical application in the
frequency of ISM (industrial, scientific and medical) band (2.4–2.48 GHz) is presented. The total size
of the proposed antenna is
20 × 20 mm2 with the thickness of 1 mm , and this antenna is embedded
in FR4 substrate with dielectric constant of 4.4. The antenna parameters show good results such as
lower return loss, perfect impedance matching, and better gain. The 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth is
2.2GHZ( from 1.2 -3.4 GHz) that is broader than the other conventional antennas. The proposed
antenna possesses the return loss of -29 dB at 2.4GHz. Thus the proposed antenna can be employed for
several implantable applications.'
