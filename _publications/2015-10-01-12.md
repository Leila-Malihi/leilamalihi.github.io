title: "Improvement in Classification Accuracy
Rate Using Multiple Classifier Fusion towards Computer Vision Detection of Malaria
Parasite (Plasmodium vivax)"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Background: The main method used for the laboratory confirmation of malaria is the conventional light microscopy; however,
microscopy has three main disadvantages: I) it is time-consuming and labor-intensive; II) its results depend heavily on good techniques,
reagents and microscopes; III) in many cases decisions about treatment are often taken without using the result of microscopy because of
long delays in providing the results to the clinician. Hence, an extreme necessity of the fast automatic detection of the disease is required
to diagnose and treat promptly.
Objectives: Through the improvement of classification accuracy rate, this work aims to present a computer-assisted diagnosis system for
malaria parasite.
Materials and Methods: This study was conducted using 400 confirmed images of blood slides infected with malaria parasite. The
MATLAB software was used for the implementation of computation procedures. Using five extracted features (flat texture, saturation
channel histogram, color histogram, gradient, and granulometry) and six classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), 1-Nearest Neighbor
(1-NN), decision tree (DT), Fisher, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)), images were classified
into two classes: parasitic and nonparasitic. Then, classifier fusion was done using several algorithms: mean, min, max, stack, median,
Adaboost, and bagging.'
