collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Malaria is one of the leading causes of death, especially in high-risk groups die infants, toddlers, and pregnant women. In the world of almost 1 million people die because of it every year. Malaria is transmitted by the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito vectors that have been infected by Plasmodium. Identification of Plasmodium in the blood is done by visual observation blood cells using a microscope. To aid this process, some research are carried out to develop identification plasmodium using methods based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and digital image processing. The infected cells are extracted typically using image grayscale. In this study, image on the pigment color space and color space are compared so that the intensity will be obtained an optimum color channels in the process of the appearance of the parasite plasmodium features. This study used a sample of Giemsa-stained blood cell images which are infected with the malaria parasite. the results of this study stated after the histogram on the image that the results are graphed evenly and no dominant, and the image looks more clear.'
