title: "New monopole planar implant antenna for
medical application"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'The design and characterization of a microstrip-fed
planar monopole antenna with circular
polarization
is
presented. The antenna operates in the Industrial, Scientific and
Medical (ISM) (5.725–5.875GHz),and WLAN (5150–5350 MHz)
with return loss lower than -10 dB. The antenna has a compact
aperture size 20 × 20 mm2, fabricated on FR4 substrate with
dielectric constant of 4.4, thickness of 1 mm. The advantages of
the proposed antenna are the simple yet efficient design of the
radiator, a 3-dB axial-ratio operating band with a compact size.'
