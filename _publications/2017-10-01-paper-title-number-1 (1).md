permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: ' In accurate remote sensing, automatic airport extraction through satellite images can be the best approach to prepare, edit, and update an efficient database.Therefore, in this article, a method for automatic airport extraction from satellite images is proposed. In the proposed method, the pre-processing of the input images was done first. For this purpose, a two-way filter has been used to reduce noise. This filter is more efficient than traditional Haas noise reduction methods such as Gaussian and preserves edges well. Also, in order to make the histogram uniform, histogram adjustment has been used.'
