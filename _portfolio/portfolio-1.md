- In [klix](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/research_groups/computer_vision/research/klix.html) project, we proposed a novel dataset ”Labeled Children in the Wild” (LCW) for facial recognition tasks, that features are more challenging (high variance) for modern face recognition solutions and freely available.
- We use a model that was pre-trained on [VGGFace]( https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/) and fine-tune its weights by training on our dataset [(Refer to my paper)](/files/face_recognition_of_children__India_2_.pdf)
