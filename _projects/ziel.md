*Extracting red blood cell mask, left is the blood cell image, right is red blood cell mask*

- A method to detect malaria parasite in blood samples stained with giemsa.
- Most of malaria parasites exist in red blood cells.
- At the first step, the red blood cell mask is extracted.
- Color histogram, granulometry, gradient and flat texture features are extracted
- Different classifires and combination methods applied [(Refer to my paper)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6780011)
