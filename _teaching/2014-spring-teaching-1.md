In this lecture we took a closer look at selected topics in deep learning with a focus on computer vision, covering theoretical and practical aspects. We discussed design principles and properties of selected neural networks starting with classifiers and then extending to selected applications like object recognition, image registration and also discuss the application of computer vision based technologies to non-standard visual domains like scanned documents and spectrograms. In the second part of the course we turn to the more theoretical works of the field, addressing currently open questions. We exemplarily discussed topics such as deep generative models, adversarial examples, introspection, and explainability. Finally we provided practical guidelines for developing deep learning solutions based on the current state of research as well industry experience.
