## Headlines of Electronic :

- An introduction to electronic physics

- junction diode:
The properties and characteristics of a junction diode are discussed, including the formation of the depletion region, forward and reverse biasing, I-V characteristics, and applications of diodes.
- Diode circuits:
This topic explores different diode circuits and their applications. It covers rectifiers, clippers, clampers, voltage multipliers, and voltage regulators.

- Bipolar junction transistor:
The principles of operation, transistor construction, and various configurations (common emitter, common base, common collector) are covered. Topics include transistor characteristics, DC biasing, load line analysis, and small-signal models.
- Design of transistor bias circuits
This topic focuses on biasing techniques for transistors to establish proper operating points. It covers fixed bias, emitter bias, voltage divider bias, and stability considerations.
- Low frequency transistor amplifiers:
This topic explores the design and analysis of low-frequency transistor amplifiers. It covers single-stage amplifiers (common emitter, common base, common collector), amplifier characteristics, and frequency response.
- Field effect transistor:
The principles of operation, FET types (JFET, MOSFET), and their characteristics are discussed. Topics include FET biasing, FET amplifiers, and FET applications.

These topics provide a foundation in electronic physics and lay the groundwork for understanding more advanced concepts in electronic devices and circuits. They form the basis for further studies in fields such as integrated circuits, digital electronics, analog electronics, and communication systems.
There are several textbooks available that cover these topics in detail. Some popular books in this area include:

- "Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory" by Robert L. Boylestad and Louis Nashelsky.
- "Microelectronic Circuits" by Adel S. Sedra and Kenneth C. Smith.
- "Electronic Principles" by Albert Malvino and David Bates.

These books provide comprehensive coverage of electronic physics, including the topics mentioned above, along with practical examples, circuit diagrams, and exercises to reinforce the concepts.[Certificate](/files/payam.jpg)
